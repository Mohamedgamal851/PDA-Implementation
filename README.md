# PDA-Implementation
## Simulate a Pushdown Automata (PDA)

• States

• Input Alphabet

• Stack Alphabet

• Transition Function

• Start State

• Accepting States

• Initial Stack Symbol

## You must simulate a Pushdown Automata (PDA) by implementing the following components and ensuring correct behavior during derivation:


• States: The set of states in the PDA.

• Input Alphabet: The set of input symbols the PDA reads

• Stack Alphabet: the set of symbols used for stack operations

• Transition Function: A mapping that defines transitions from one state to another based
on:.

▪ current state,

▪ current input symbol (or ε for empty),

▪ top of the stack to be popped from the stack .

## It specifies the new state and the new symbol to be pushed into the stack.

• Start State: state where computation begins from

• Accepting States: set of final states

• Initial Stack Symbol: The symbol pushed first into the stack

## For each problem, pass the PDA configuration (States, Input Alphabet, Stack Alphabet, Transition Function, Start State, Accepting States, Initial Stack Symbol) to your simulation class (or function) and ensure it correctly processes input strings.

## PDA:
1. Design a PDA for accepting a language { a
nb
mc
n
|n,m>=0}

2. Design a PDA for accepting a language {a3nb 2n n>=1}.

3. Design a PDA for accepting a language that consists of strings of balanced
left and right brackets.

4. Design a PDA for accepting a language {anb
n+mc
m| n , m>=1}.

5. Design a PDA for language {Wck | W ∈ {a,b}* and n >=0 and k = |W|b (k=the number of b in W)}
